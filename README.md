## Arduino

### Installation

To compile Arduino code, you need to install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
Then you need to copy the ArduinoView folder to the Arduino libraries folder. On Windows, this is usually `C:\Users\<username>\Documents\Arduino\libraries`.
This folder contains the ArduinoView library and the example sketches.
