# Introduction

Arduino is a micro-controller platform for education, prototyping and one of a kind projects like they often happen in arts, science and development, it is well known, taught to and learned by beginners, students, designers, scientists and professionals. Arduino has a huge community of amateurs and professionals that develop hard- and software around the platform which has already many sensors, actors, shields and other hardware and driver libraries available to it. Arduinoview will provide a way to provide a graphical user interface with an Arduino project by using the USB-serial interface of the Arduino and an interpreter running inside a web browser.

## Goals

The goal of the project is to develop an simple framework to combine Arduino and a graphical user interface that will be displayed on a PC.
